# Operating System Concurrency and Deadlock Prevention

This repository contains solutions to the fourth series of exercises for the Operating Systems course. The exercises focus on implementing concurrency control mechanisms such as **locks**, **semaphores**, and **deadlock prevention** techniques. Below is a list of the problems solved in this repository:

## Problems Solved

1. **Automated Factory Assembly Line**
   - Simulates a factory assembly line with multiple stages which supports concurrency.

2. **Network Packet Transmission**
   - Simulates packet transmission over a network to handle concurrency and packet drops.

3. **Intersection Management**
   - Implements a deadlock-free traffic management system for a robotic car intersection which allows simultaneous movement without collisions.
   > This solution is based on Dijkstra's algorithm to dining philosophers problem.

4. **AI Agents Pathfinding**
   - Simulates multiple AI agents moving on a grid while avoiding collisions.
